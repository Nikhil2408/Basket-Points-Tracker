# Basket-Points-Tracker

The App can help in keeping a track of the scores scored by Team A and Team B in a match. Whatever points are gained by a particular team, the corresponding button can be pressed to add those points in a team's score. After the match is over, the scores can be reset to 0 by pressing the RESET button.
